## ðŸ¤” What is this?

Currently there's no convenient way to view PRs & history data in Fitbod
without finding each exercise under muscle groups.
So I made this small dashboard app to view export data in a nicer way.

Note: FitData isn't endorsed by Fitbod.

## How to use this?

1. Open settings in Fitpod
2. Export Workout Data
3. Save to Files
4. Open that csv file in FitData

Note: This is a PWA (can "Add to Home Screen" via "Share menu").

## ðŸ›  Development

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
